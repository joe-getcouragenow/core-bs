# core-bs

core Bootstrap provides the tooling.

Projects can make their main and modules as they see fit, and use this tooling for them.

## Status

Installing of makefile works.
Installing of tools does not, due to relying on fish.


## Development

Core-bs is really just a thing that grabs an embeds bootstrap things from core-runtime. SO make changes there.

Its designed this way because core-runtime needs the bootstraps files itself in order to itself run code.


## Functions

It has:

1. binary tools that are reused on projects

2. make files that are reused on projects

3. core flutter and golang code that are reused on projects.

It covers the following scenarios:

1. Dev time - when developing.

2. Compile time - when compiling.

3. Deploy time - when deploying locally or to Kubernetes.

4. Ops time - when managing the deployment.


## Dev time

Bootstrap your OS with the tools needed.

``` bs init ```

- Installs the required binaries and boilerplate files.


``` bs config ```

- Configures the settings you want for your project, such as project name, domain name, configuration settings.


``` bs scaffold ```

- Scaffold the required workflows and configurations using code generation.


## Compile time

Compile your flutter GUI and MicroServices.

``` bs run ```

- Run it

``` bs build ```

- Build it

``` bs pack ```

- Package it.

``` bs sign ```

- Sign it.

## Run time

Run your project locally or in Kubernetes locally or in the cloud.

``` bs config flag ```

- changes your runtime configurations affected the running system using feature flags that are present in your modules configuration.

``` bs config flag -ps ```

- same as above but globally and persistent in the DB.

## Deploy time

Deploy your project to a linux server or a Kubernetes cloud.

``` bs deploy server ```

- Deploy the server

``` bs deploy app ```

- Deploys the apps to the app stores.


## Examples

See the core-examples repo.

## CI

The CI builds the binaries as a github release.
